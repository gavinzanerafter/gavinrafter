Coding for kids is an important skill to have for the generation. Many youth have made major web browsers and search engines in the past 20 years such as: _Google_, _ksgv2_ and _Mozilla Firefox_. Here I will browse over my personal _opinions_ of where to start.

## Scratch

For young coders just getting started, I highly recommend `Scratch`. It gives you many options. It is great for a kid that wants to make a pretty straightforward game. It is by far the best choice for a quick, fun game. Although I would love new blocks and ways to _write_ `variables`. Overall I think it is the best place to start `boolean logic`.

## Code.org

Code.org is a fun way to start coding having by far the most options and customizable choices.
