Coding for kids is an important skill to have for the generation. Many youth have made major web browsers and search engines in the past 20 years such as: _Google_, _ksgv2_ and _Mozilla Firefox_. Here I will quickly browse over my personal _opinions_ of where to start in this miniature post.

## Scratch

For young coders just getting started, I highly recommend `Scratch`. It gives you many options. It is great for a kid that wants to make a pretty straightforward game. It is by far the best choice for a quick, fun game. Although I would love new blocks including returning functions and setTimeout(). Overall I think it is the best place to start `boolean logic`.

## Code.org

Code.org is a fun way to start coding having many options and customizable choices. Ranging from coding an app in text to teaching a Minecraft character to play tag with an Iron golem. For customizing your magnificent ideas `Code.org` is where to go.

## Tynker

I have heard many good things about `Tynker`, though I have never tried it myself. I believe mainly because of the pricing. I personally believe that a kid should have more than 30-60 min/month of coding without paying. Saying that, I highly recommend `Tynker` for beginners.

## Glitch

`Glitch` is by far the most complicated for beginners but it is the best for learning the true art of website making. I recommend you go into it with some knowledge of `Javascript` and `HTML`. But I _love_ hopping on and creating a quick and easy website.

## Conclusion

My conclusion of what to do is that it's completely up to the user. Users have their own opinions and they should find their passion of computing. Thanks for reading this post. Also check out:
